In a world plagued by relentless evil, buying time for peace and prosperity can become a desperate necessity. When hurt, anger, and fear of the unknown provide endless tools for the greatest villains to recruit new minions and rise again, they can never be gone for good. 

You are a card-carrying member of the Magical Corrections Union, a little-known organization with a recruiting problem (you are its founder and only surviving member). Although you rarely get the glory, you offer the vital service of taking a tireless force of chaos and preventing it from returning (with an 18-month money-back satisfaction guarantee). Your patented process calls for taking the body parts of the vampire lord, vengeful undead, or fugitive mage and distributing them.

Until you deposit each artifact, it allows you to use one of Morgan's powerful spells. Take care to plan for what you will do after they are hidden, or you may be trapped forever with her!
