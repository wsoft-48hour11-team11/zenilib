In a world plagued by relentless evil, destroying those who lead the forces of chaos is more than even heroes can hope for. When hurt, anger, and fear of the unknown provide endless tools for the greatest villains to recruit new minions and rise again, they can never be gone for good. Instead, heroes turn to strange magic to buy as much time as they can for peace and prosperity to resurge.

You are a card-carrying member of Fiendish Severance Services, a little-known organization with a recruiting problem (you are its founder and only surviving member). Although you rarely get the glory, you offer the vital service of taking a tireless force of chaos and preventing it from returning (with an 18-month money-back satisfaction guarantee). Your patented process calls for taking the body parts of the arch-demon, vengeful undead, or fugitive mage and distributing them to secure magical chests that can contain them for as long as all the parts remain sealed. The hard part is putting them in before the demon revives from the parts you carry.

Until you deposit each artifact, it allows you to use one of the evil's powers. Take care to plan for what you will do after they are sealed away, or you may be trapped forever with them!
