A vampire, consumed by rage and vindictiveness at a lover's betrayal a thousand years ago and before his own death, has spent the intervening years trying to fill the hole in his heart left by her murder by seducing and draining the vitality from countless innocent people. He was careless enough to leave his coffin unguarded once while traveling, which was all you needed to steal in and deliver a stake to the heart. But now the remains need to be disposed of.
