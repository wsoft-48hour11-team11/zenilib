In the land of Logres, a cabal of mysterious wizards have beguiled the king into withdrawing from his court and threatened to lay waste to whole nations who dare offend him. Morgan Le Fay, a powerful witch and the king's sister, has separated them from the king and tricked them into passing through a magic portal. The portal bound the wizards' powers into their gifts, and they can never return so long as the artifacts are kept separate in crystalline prisons. However, Morgan cannot venture into these caves to seal them away for good, or her power will be lost as well.

You are Morgan's apprentice, Nimue. Your magic is not yet strong enough to be affected, and so she entrusts you with hiding her enemies' weapons.

Until you deposit each artifact, it allows you to use one of the wizard's powerful spells. Take care to plan for what you will do after they are hidden, or you may be trapped forever with them!

"Hurry!" Morgan warns. "Little time remains before the first of them recovers!"
