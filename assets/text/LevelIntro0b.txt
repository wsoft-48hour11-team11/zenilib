In the land of Logres, the infamous witch Morgan Le Fay has been trapped by the respected wizard Merlin. Morgan's power has been broken into her greatest magical tools, and she can never return so long as they are kept separate in crystalline prisons beneath a powerful ley line. However, he cannot venture into these caves, or his power will be lost as well.

You are his apprentice, Nimue. Your magic is not yet strong enough to be affected, and so he entrusts you with hiding Morgan's artifacts.

Until you deposit each artifact, it allows you to use one of Morgan's powerful spells. Take care to plan for what you will do after they are hidden, or you may be trapped forever with her!

"Make haste!" Merlin warns. "Little time remains before Morgan recovers!"
